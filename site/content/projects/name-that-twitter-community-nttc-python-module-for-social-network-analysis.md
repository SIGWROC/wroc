title: 'Name That Twitter Community! (nttc): Python module for social network analysis'
url: nttc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
description: >-
  A set of functions that process and create topic models from a sample of
  community-detected Twitter networks' tweets. It also analyzes if there are
  potential persistent community hubs. It assumes you have a desire to
  investigate communities across periods and the tweets from each detected
  community across already defined periodic episodes with the goal of naming
  each community AND examining their respective topics over time in the corpus.
