description: >-
  The Hedge-O-Matic tokenizes raw text at the sentence level. Each sentence is
  then classified as either a hedge or non-hedge by a Support Vector Machine
  trained on a corpus of hedgey and non-hedgey sentences culled from academic
  science journals. It outputs results as a table of tagged sentences and a
  scatter plot that denotes the linear distribution of hedgey and non-hedgey
  sentences in the submitted text.
