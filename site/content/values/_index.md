      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.

    text: >
      Sustainable maintenance is coding in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What users need and where and how their
      needs change are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature
      and communities.
