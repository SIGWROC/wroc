      For over 30 years, writing and rhetoric scholars have explored the 
      relationships between programming, writing, and rhetoric. This body  of
      work has built from the premise that code is writing: it has dynamic 
      purposes, authors, and audiences both human and machine. Out of this 
      legacy, a growing number of scholars are actively conducting research  and
      developing pedagogies rooted in understanding the communicative and 
      rhetorical dimensions of computer programming. As a means to sustain this 
      scholarly community, we formed a NCTE/CCCC Special Interest group in 2017,
      so we could solidify our field and presence across the discipline.
