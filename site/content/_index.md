    We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable
    piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum
    ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive
    me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's
    interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to
    neutralize the homing signal.

    Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon
    torpedoes. Something strange on the detector circuit. The weapons must have
    disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but
    inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters.
    Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the
    beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.
